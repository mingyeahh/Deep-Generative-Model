# Deep-Generative-Model
This is a third year deep learning coursework at Durham University. The objective of this project is to produce realistic 128 x 128 resolution images of human faces trained using the FFHQ dataset with LightweightGAN. To achieve this goal, three different approaches have been attempted: direct implementation from the research paper from scratch, code adaptation from Lucidrains on Github, and final presentation via the reconstruction of LightweightGAN based on StyleGAN and the [implementation]( https://github.com/silentz/Towards-Faster-And-Stabilized-GAN-Training-For-High-Fidelity-Few-Shot-Image-Synthesis). The presented model structure not only adapts and reconstructs the original architecture to suit the target output resolution, but it also achieves improved performance while maintaining high computational efficiency.
